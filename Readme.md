# LLMCompass Implementation on FPGA (ALVEO)

This repository contains the implementation of **LLMCompass** for FPGA using the **Xilinx ALVEO** platform. It provides simulation, analysis, and documentation to support FPGA-based deployment of the LLMCompass model.

##  Repository Contents

- **LLMCompass/**  
  Core implementation scripts and necessary model files for running LLMCompass on ALVEO.

- **Aero.png**  
  Visual architecture diagram illustrating the system or data flow.

- **LLMCompass_Simulation_Presentation.pdf**  
  Presentation slide deck summarizing the simulation setup, workflow, and results.

- **LLMCompass_AE_Appendix.pdf**  
  Appendix with supplementary engineering details, design rationale, or additional schematics.

- **LLMCompass_Simulation_Report.pdf**  
  Detailed report covering methodology, simulation results, performance benchmarks, and analysis.

- **important_note(pls_read_before_implementation).txt**  
  Critical instructions or caveats to review prior to attempting implementation on FPGA.
