This is the refernce implementation of the paper of LLMCompass on a FPGA Aluveo U280, the hardware of the ALVEO U280 FPGA and 
the computational graph is defined and stored in the following folder 'LLMCompass -> ae -> llama2_7b'.


The output of the ''run_llama2_unoptimized_ALVEOU100.py'' model is stored in the 'LLMCompass -> results -> llama2_sim'.

The simulation_results.json contains the output of the model that is time consumed for all the operation of all the  layers in llama2_7b language model.
